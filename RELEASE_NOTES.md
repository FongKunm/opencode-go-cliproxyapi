## What's Changed

### Bug Fixes

- Fix `tool_result` translation when receiving `tool_reference` content blocks from Claude clients (such as ToolSearch, web search, or web fetch in Claude Code), preventing 500 errors and conversation lockouts on Chat Completions and Responses models like DeepSeek.

Special thanks to @SpiGAndromeda in #14.

## Upgrade Notes

- Replace the old plugin binary with the new release binary.
